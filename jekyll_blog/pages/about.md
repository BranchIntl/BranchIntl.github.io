At Branch, we build technology that powers financial access for millions across emerging markets, and this blog is our space to share how we do it. Here, our engineers write about the systems, patterns, tools, and cultural practices that shape our work—from designing resilient distributed architectures and scaling mobile experiences, to improving reliability, automation, and developer productivity. We document not only our technical decisions, but also the lessons, failures, and insights gathered along the way. Our goal is to contribute back to the community, spark meaningful conversations, and help other teams learn from the challenges and breakthroughs we experience while building and operating a global fintech platform.
